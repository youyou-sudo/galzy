Netorare is more than a simple act of infidelity, but the fetishization of jealousy and other negative feelings commonly associated with it.\n\nFor a game to be classified as Netorare the following conditions must be met:\n\n1. The protagonist's significant other, a very close friend, or in some cases, a close relative is stolen from him by someone seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques. It doesn't necessarily mean that they are literally stolen, but the negative feelings experienced by their significant other might make it seem so.\n\n2. The one who loses their loved one almost always finds out about the situation and suffers from jealousy and the feeling of helplessness arisen from an inability to change anything. The one stealing the lover and/or the stolen loved one might rub it in by humiliating the loser in private or in public.\n\n3. The trait does [b]not[/b] apply if the character having sex with someone else does not have a close loving relationship with the protagonist, and if the protagonist does not experience jealousy and other negative feelings upon finding out about the act. In other words, the ties between the partners and their forcible separation is important to the netorare fetish. For example, an unrequited crush or a potential hero(ine) on a different route would not count for the purposes of this fetish.\n\n4. The act of stealing must happen while the protagonist is in a relationship with the stolen significant other. Scenes of heroine's past relationships do not count as Netorare.\n\nThe game is usually portrayed from the perspective of someone losing his significant other, in order to delve deep into the jealousy aspect of the fetish, however, for story purposes the game might switch between multiple POVs and also portray the events from the perspective of the stolen SO."

The protagonist steals the significant other, a very close friend, or in extremely rare cases, a close relative from another character by seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping them, or by using other techniques.\n\n2. The character stolen must be someone you are not supposed to steal. As an example, the protagonist having sex with someone's mother wouldn't be Netori, if she doesn't have a significant other. However, it would become Netori if she is the protagonist's own mother, and the father is present in the game in some form.\n\n3. For Netori-themed games the finding out aspect is less important, as the game focuses on the protagonist and his conquest. Still, the losing character needs to exist within the game and play some role related to his SO being stolen. If the losing character does not appear or is barely mentioned, the game should be tagged with [url=/g1380]Infidelity[/url] instead of Netori.\n\n4.

It features advanced science, such as information technology and cybernetics, coupled with a degree of breakdown or radical change in the social order.\n\nCyberpunk plots often center on a conflict among hackers, artificial intelligences, and megacorporations, and tend to be set in a near-future Earth, rather than the far-future settings or galactic vistas found in novels such as Isaac Asimov's Foundation or Frank Herbert's Dune. The settings are usually post-industrial dystopias but tend to be marked by extraordinary cultural ferment and the use of technology in ways never anticipated by its creators (\"the street finds its own uses for things\").\n\n[From [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberpunk]Wikipedia[/url]]"

The protagonist is stolen from his significant other by someone seducing, coercing, blackmailing, outright raping him, or by using other techniques. For example, the married male protagonist might meet another woman who, over the course of the game, seduces him, and takes him away from his wife.\n\n2. The protagonist's significant other almost always finds out about the situation and suffers from jealousy and the feeling of helplessness arisen from an inability to change anything. The one stealing the protagonist and/or the protagonist might rub it in by humiliating the losing SO in private or in public.\n\n3. The trait does [b]not[/b] apply if the protagonist having sex with someone else does not experience naughty feelings related to the taboo of cheating, and possibly destroying his established relationship. In other words, the pre-existing ties between the protagonist and their SO are important to the reverse netorare fetish.\n\n4. The act of stealing must happen while the protagonist is in a current relationship. Scenes of protagonist's past relationships do not count as Reverse Netorare.\n\nThe game is usually portrayed from the perspective of protagonist, who is seduced into abandoning his significant other,  however, for story purposes the game might switch between multiple POVs and also portray the events from the perspective of the loser SO."

OLs are often unmarried and live with their parents well into early adulthood. Office ladies are usually full-time permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for promotion, and there is usually the tacit expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\nOften nicknamed shokuba no hana or \"office flower\", these women suffer discrimination due to the M-Curve. Office ladies are usually hired right after high school or junior high, with university graduates discouraged from pursuing this type of career. They are kept around the office for the youth they bring to it, hence the \"flower\" nickname. They are charged with routine, menial tasks meant to support the male workers.

Office ladies are usually full-time permanent staff, although the jobs they do usually have little opportunity for promotion, and there is usually the tacit expectation that they leave their jobs once they get married.\n\nOften nicknamed shokuba no hana or \"office flower\", these women suffer discrimination due to the M-Curve. Office ladies are usually hired right after high school or junior high, with university graduates discouraged from pursuing this type of career.

Ryona as a fetish revolves around a victim, almost exclusively a humanoid female, being physically assaulted or psychologically abused by an offender.\n\nIt differs from sadism in that it is a voyeuristic fantasy fetish with focus towards fictional characters from video games, anime, comics, TV and movies that include battering, abusing or otherwise killing women. Characters from movies and TV series represented by live actresses are becoming more common as less stigmatism is attached to violence being inflicted to women in media. Because the fetish is so broad it often incorporates other, more common, fetishes such as humiliation, rape, and BDSM depending on the preference of the individual. Often the victim is any combination of physically fit, well trained, or strong of will as many find ryona more appealing the greater the gap between the victim and offender's usual power.\n\nIn case the victim is male it is often labeled as gyaku-ryona. Fairly popular among females, and even some males especially when the assailant is a female."

It may be a cloth patch attached around the head by an elastic band or by a string, or an adhesive bandage. It is often worn by people to cover a lost or injured eye, but it also has a therapeutic use in children for the treatment of amblyopia."

Life extension strategies often study the causes of aging and try to oppose those causes in order to slow aging. Rejuvenation is the reversal of aging and thus requires a different strategy, namely repair of the damage that is associated with aging or replacement of damaged tissue with new tissue. Rejuvenation can be a means of life extension, but most life extension strategies do not involve rejuvenation."

The player can only read a certain amount of the VN in a single day, but can pay to read more. This is often represented by a \"tickets\" system in VNs, or a \"stamina\" or \"energy\" gauge in other types of games.\n\n2. When the player comes to a choice point, the \"best\" choice requires the player to pay to select it. This may simply unlock a CG or may be required for a good ending.\n\n3.

Use g2711 for games that include this mechanic.\n\nDo not use this tag for games which have a free prologue then allow you to buy individual routes (these are functionally identical to a demo and a paid game) or for games which have paid side stories or similar bonus content (these are just normal DLC) unless they also contain another type of microtransaction mechanic."

For example, it could include the addition of tentacles or covering the body in the form of living clothes. The characters may or may not be able to control the changes or the additional parts.\n\nThe effects may cause the character to become sexually active, lose their minds, or be controlled by the creatures. It is possible that the parasite or symbiote could give the characters supernatural or extraordinary powers and abilities at a price."

The affected character is usually initially described as innocent/prude, smart, diligent, or simply unassuming, however the circumstances align to turn them into an oversexed sexpot, usually known as a [url=/i3547]Bimbo[/url]. The usual changes experienced by the character are these:\n\n1. Looks: Character starts dressing in revealing and eye-catching clothing, wear gaudy make-up and lots of fashion accessories, dye their hair (blonde colour dominates, but other variations are possible). Frequently bimbos employ plastic surgery to enhance their looks. Tattoos and piercing are also occasionally proudly displayed.\n\n2. Outlook: The character starts craving hedonistic activities and frequently participates in parties and other social gatherings. They usually become sexually [url=/g1667]promiscuous[/url] and start having sex with multiple partners. They might even get involved in sex work.\n\n3. Intelligence: In fantasy/sci-fi settings the character usually is subjected to mental degradation that somehow decreases their intelligence. In real world setting, the character reprioritizes their lifestyle, usually dropping out of school, retiring from work, in order to seek a more hedonistic and social lifestyle. Drug use and abuse is also pretty common in such works.\n\nA particular variation of the trope present in Japan is Gyarufication (and by extension Gangurofication), where a normal high school girl (or a young woman) usually falls in with a bad crowd, and over the course of the game starts displaying looks and attitude associated with the negative [url=/i1219]Gyaru[/url] / [url=/i1054]Ganguro[/url] stereotypes.
